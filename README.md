Movie-Cliches
-------------

Movies have their own language. Besides the whole "**Let's go**", "**Yes sir**", "**Go go go**" shenanigans that I usually don't use so much in my daily life (which is surprisingly bereft of machine guns and tanks), there are certain common sentences that you just keep hearing over and over again in movies.

I scraped ~1500 movie scripts to see which sentences are overused. Interestingly, "**I love you**" ended up pretty low, somewhere close to 90th place. Two ranks below "**Shut up**", in fact.

Also, it turns out Charlie Kaufman uses "**I don't know**", like, ALL the time. 19 times in _Synecdoche, NY_ and 18 times in _Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind_.
